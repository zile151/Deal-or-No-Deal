About
-----
Deal or No Deal is the American version of the international game show of Dutch origin of the same name. The show was hosted by Howie Mandel, and premiered on December 19, 2005, on NBC. The hour-long show typically aired at least twice a week during its run.

The game is primarily unchanged from the international format where a contestant chooses one briefcase from a selection of 26. Each briefcase contains a cash value from $.01 to $1,000,000. Over the course of the game, the contestant eliminates the other cases, periodically being presented with a "deal" from The Banker to take a cash amount to quit the game. Should the contestant refuse every deal, they were given the chance to trade the original case for the only other one left in play, and won whatever money was in the chosen case after this possible exchange.

The show was a success for NBC, typically averaging from 10-16 million viewers each episode in the first season, although the subsequent seasons only averaged about 5-9 million viewers each episode. It led to the creation of tie-in board, card, and video games, as well as a syndicated series played for smaller dollar amounts. The show went on hiatus in early 2009, and its Friday night time slot was replaced with Mandel's other series Howie Do It.

How to Play
-----------

When the program starts a menu will appear with the options to choose adventure mode or original Deal or No Deal. The adventure mode is explained above and original is a one time play mode where the user tries to win the highest amount. When the game appears the user selects 1 case to save until the end and 6 cases to remove. The player will then be asked if he/she wants to accept a certain dollar amount offered by the banker depending on what cases were removed. The user can accept the offer with the deal button and be taken to a victory screen or decline the offer with the no deal button and proceed to the next round. In each round after the first the user will be asked to choose 1 less case but never less than 1 case. After selecting the given rounds cases the banker will then offer deals in the same format as the first round. If the user declines every deal given to them they will have a final choice between 2 cases. The user will then choose their final case and win whatever dollar amount is inside that case and be taken to the victory screen.
In Adventure Mode, if you fail to achieve a certain money value then you will be taken into a "defeat" screen instead.
Most times, to continue playing after a victory screen has been shown, simply click anywhere to continue.
